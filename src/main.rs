            Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers,
            did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I
            will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the
            Janus Key.  Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno
            want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the
            baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the
            redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The
            Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this

            Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise
            he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create
            life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even
            keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force
            is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He
            became so powerfulâ€¦ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his
            power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught
            his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in
            his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
